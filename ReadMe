This is a stripped version of Lucifer06 RemoteGPIO package This fork removes serial starter rules file changes, and 
removes all checks and flow installs for node red. This is intended for use with wifi router, built in wifi ap, or 
ethernet cable. This will not work for USB connected rs485. For that, use the original RemoteGPIO repository by 
Lucifer06. Stripping the afore mentioned functions from the setup script dramatically improves the install time. 
Instead of taking a few minutes to install it now takes just a few seconds

This package is mainly targeting Cerbo GX users that wants to extend Digital Inputs and Relays on their system.
Please note that there is a conflict with Kwindrem's RpiGpioSetup that is targeting Raspberry pi users

This Dingtian box provide 8x relays, that can be controlled with Modbus Serial, but also over IP and with various 
additional protocols: https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000999069820.html
They have variants of 2, 4 or 8 relays.

SETUP:
=====
The setup is now fully automated, no more requirement to issue shell commands! :-)
It runs only with VenusOS Large with minimum version 2.92

1/ Configure the Relay Module
CONFIGURATION OF THE RELAY MODULE Connect the ethernet interface of the module and access to its configuration page 
(192.168.1.100 and admin/admin by default) you can also connect directly to the relay module wireless AP to complete 
the setup: AP IP = 192.168.7.1, ssid = dtrelay(xxxx), password = dtpassword on the settings tab: you will need to set 
either the ETH or STA settings depending on which connection method used. Make note of the IP address. on the relay 
connect tab: Configure TCP Server to Modbus-TCP and local port 502

2/ VenusOS Large
Install the desired VenusOS Large version (minimum v2.92) 
Enable Node-RED (Settings/Venus OS Large features)

3/ Install RemoteGPIO_tcpip
Make sure SetupHelper from Kwindrem is installed. If not follow instructions from https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper
Add RemoteGPIO_tcpip repo: RemoteGPIO_tcpip thomasinaz41213 latest
Download and install the package

4/ Open node red in a browser and import/deploy the Digital Inputs and Relays json's from the files section of this repo 
(both flows are necessary for full function of the relays). If you are using a 2 or 4 relay module and not an 8 relay module,
you can disable or delete the additional relays and inputs from the flows.You will need to open the tcpip node and set the IP address to what you previously set in the dingtian relay config.

Using RemoteGPIO_tcpip:
=================
1/ RemoteGPIO_tcpip can be used from VenusOS GUI to control 4x additional relays.
It is required to install Kwindrem's GuiMods package (https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods)
Go to Settings/Relay there are 4x additional relays to be enabled and then use the dedicated Relay page that should 
display the additional relays

2/ RemoteGPIO_tcpip can also be used with Node-RED
With Node-Red it is possible to use all 8x relays as well as the 8x digital inputs.
Multiple relay modules can be installed and used simultaniously by assigning each module it's own ip address.
